      <h1>About Project2!</h1>
      <p>
        This is my second project in this journey of Software Engineering.I have
        enjoyed the whole process of building this site, from the brainstorm all
        the way to the end of this paragraph. I'm really happy to be able to
        look back and see all the process I have made and I realized that I will
        go anywhere as long as is forward. In this project I decided to worked
        with a weather app because I'm a big fan of the environment and I think
        is so important to monitor it, espeacially today with global warming
        just keep getting worse. The focus of the app is to provide accurate
        weather information for all the users that wonder "what's is the weather
        like where I'm going?". With this app the user can simple do a "quick
        search" and instanlly they'll be getting current weather information of
        the location they searched.
